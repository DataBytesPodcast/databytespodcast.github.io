We discuss NVIDIA's AI-generated faces that look incredibly authentic, and relatedly, OpenAI's text generator that is so capable that it has to be kept under wraps. We then assess the study design of a recent research article that considered how health outcomes vary amongst African Americans of different skin tones.
